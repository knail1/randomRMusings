very visually aesthetic and well written. some comments (i didnt ding you on them)
1. you need to normalize your data before lasso/elastic net (you can use the scale() function which uses the common standardization approach (x-u)/sd). without scaling, some of your coefficients will be artificially large or small and some of the covariants will be treated unfairly resulting in an inefficient model

12.1 you were going somewhere with this, but stopped short on "how" you would set up the design for the experiments with the heart patients
