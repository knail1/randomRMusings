```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


**4. (Optional) Compare the results and quality of classification models (e.g., SVM, KNN) build using**
**(1) the data sets from questions 1,2,3;**
**(2) the data that remains after data points with missing values are removed; and**
**(3) the data set when a binary variable is introduced to indicate missing values.**

for this question, we need to do the following:

- split the data into training and validation sets: 70/30
- develop the SVM or KNN model with
  - mean/mode imputation method to impute values for the missing data
  - regression to impute values for the missing data
  - regression with perturbation to impute values for the missing data
  - just the data without missing values
  
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
