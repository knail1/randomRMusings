prologue note: I think there was an explicit ask for providing a separate R script. Personally I like RMD better as the code is emeded with doco; In the future, please ensure you extract all the R code and put that in a separate R script and upload that too along with your RMD PDF.  
Q1. Interesting idea. Not sure where you'll get your training data for systems which are hacked and show abnormal traffic and behavioral patterns. You have to always ask the question, "do I have the data?". If there isn't, then your first job is to collect this data.

Q2.2 clean.  liked your smart use of c(10^(-4:6)) to create the C array. also, elegant way of printing  equation.
Q2.2.2. the idea is to iterate through the Cs,  the optimum weight is different for each model.
Q2.2.3. you sampled 60% of train data, but didnt measure against 40% test data. your results are off , k=5 is optimum.

Summary: try to uplevel to "what" the results are telling you like 3.1.b eg why higher Cs dontchange accuracy etc
