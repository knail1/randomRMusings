## Origins:
document I created watching Hadley Wickham's whole game youtube video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go5Au01Jrvs

apparently all of this is already here:
https://github.com/hadley/building-permits

but i'm doing this from scratch, to learn...

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Data import

Data downloaded from: https://github.com/hadley/building-permits/blob/master/dataPermit_full.csv


```{r}
permits_raw <- read_csv("dataPermit_full.csv", na = "null")
permits_raw
```

## Data

- date: month/year
- f1 : 1 family house
- f24 : 2-4 families
- f5 : 5 family units
- unit : number of buildings
- change in units
- value : value of building
- valchange : change in value

```{r}
permitLastTenYears <- permits_raw %>%
  separate(date, c("month", "year"), "/", convert = TRUE) %>% filter(year > 2007)
```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
