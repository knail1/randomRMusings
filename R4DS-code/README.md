# Code for R4DS (book by Hadley and Garrett)
- I keep most of the play-around code here
- the references are collapsed in their respective directories
- the code is broken apart within the comments using X.Y where
	- X = page number
	- Y = the code snippet OR the question asked in the page..
	- e.g. 50.1 = code snippet on page 50 , 50.Q1 = q1 in th exercises on pg 51
